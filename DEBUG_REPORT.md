# Debugging Report

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Application Initialization Issues

#### Problem
The application was failing to initialize properly due to incorrect import order in `wsgi.py` and configuration issues in the `Procfile`.

#### Solution
- Fixed `wsgi.py` to properly import both the app object and main function
- Removed unnecessary `--chdir .` flag from the Gunicorn command in `Procfile`
- Added proper error handling and return values in the main initialization function

### 2. Webhook Setup Issues

#### Problem
The webhook setup process lacked proper error handling and validation, which could lead to silent failures.

#### Solution
- Added validation for the bot parameter and WEBHOOK_URL format
- Implemented deletion of existing webhooks before setting new ones
- Added verification of webhook setup response
- Enhanced error logging throughout the webhook setup process

### 3. Error Handling Improvements

#### Problem
The application had minimal error handling, making it difficult to diagnose issues when they occurred.

#### Solution
- Added comprehensive try-except blocks in the main application initialization
- Improved error handling in the webhook route
- Enhanced error handling in the run.py script for local development
- Added specific error messages and logging throughout the application

## Testing

To verify the fixes, we created the following test scripts:

1. `tests/initialization_test.py` - Tests the application initialization process
2. `tests/webhook_test.py` - Tests the webhook functionality
3. `run_tests.py` - A script to run all tests and verify application functionality

## Running the Tests

To run the tests and verify the application functionality:

```bash
python run_tests.py
```

## Deployment

The application can now be deployed using the following commands:

```bash
# For production deployment
gunicorn wsgi:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT

# For local development
python run.py
```

## Future Recommendations

1. Add more comprehensive unit tests for all components
2. Implement continuous integration to run tests automatically
3. Add more detailed logging throughout the application
4. Consider implementing a more robust error handling strategy
5. Add monitoring and alerting for production deployments
